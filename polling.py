    """Poll by calling a target function until a certain condition is met. You must specify at least a target
    function to be called and the step -- base wait time between each function call.

    :param step: Step defines the amount of time to wait (in seconds)
    :param args: Arguments to be passed to the target function
    :type kwargs: dict
    :param kwargs: Keyword arguments to be passed to the target function
    :param timeout: The target function will be called until the time elapsed is greater than the maximum timeout
    (in seconds). NOTE that the actual execution time of the function *can* exceed the time specified in the timeout.
    For instance, if the target function takes 10 seconds to execute and the timeout is 21 seconds, the polling
    function will take a total of 30 seconds (two iterations of the target --20s which is less than the timeout--21s,
    and a final iteration)
    :param max_tries: Maximum number of times the target function will be called before failing
    :param check_success: A callback function that accepts the return value of the target function. It should
    return true if you want the polling function to stop and return this value. It should return false if you want it
    to continue executing. The default is a callback that tests for truthiness (anything not False, 0, or empty
    collection).
    :param step_function: A callback function that accepts each iteration's "step." By default, this is constant,
    but you can also pass a function that will increase or decrease the step. As an example, you can increase the wait
    time between calling the target function by 10 seconds every iteration until the step is 100 seconds--at which
    point it should remain constant at 100 seconds

    >>> def my_step_function(step):
    >>>     step += 10
    >>>     return max(step, 100)

    :type ignore_exceptions: tuple
    :param ignore_exceptions: You can specify a tuple of exceptions that should be caught and ignored on every
    iteration. If the target function raises one of these exceptions, it will be caught and the exception
    instance will be pushed to the queue of values collected during polling. Any other exceptions raised will be
    raised as normal.
    :param poll_forever: If set to true, this function will retry until an exception is raised or the target's
    return value satisfies the check_success function. If this is not set, then a timeout or a max_tries must be set.
    :type collect_values: Queue
    :param collect_values: By default, polling will create a new Queue to store all of the target's return values.
    Optionally, you can specify your own queue to collect these values for access to it outside of function scope.
    :return: Polling will return first value from the target function that meets the condions of the check_success
    callback. By default, this will be the first value that is not None, 0, False, '', or an empty collection.
